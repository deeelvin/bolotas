This a game idea that I had a few years ago when I played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/17390/SPORE/">Spore</a>. <br>
I've started learning SFML for other side project and thought "Why not?". <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL21OsoBLPpMOO6zyVlxZ4S4hwkY_SLRW9">This</a> tutorial by Hilze Vonck (even 8 years later) helped me a lot to get started with SFML. Of course a lot has changed since back then he used SFML 2.4 and now we have version 3.0, but the documentation is pretty decent and it's pretty easy to understand the basics. <br>
